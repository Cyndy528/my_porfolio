					<h4 class="main_headings"><strong>I'm An Educator</strong></h4>
		      <p>I'm passionate about teaching and coaching. I spent my early career as an educational instructor teaching after-school programs and advising high school students. I've cultivated a literacy-learning environment for bilingual students and coached parents. I've also facilitated workshops and mentored college students.</p>
		      <p>My most fulfilling experience was advocating for minority students and help raise college funds through local businesses and grants. In addition, I've designed learning modules, lessons and other educational materials to enhance the learning experience. I'm an advocated for teaching, with the skill to influence and impact the lives of people.</p>

		  		<h4 class="main_headings"><strong>I'm A Developer</strong></h4>
		  		<p>I'm curious about languages. I recently transitioned to web development and built web applications. I'm proficient in front-end languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, in addition to front-end frameworks: jQuery and Bootstrap. I have experience with responsive web sites, Visio, SharePoint, SEO Compliancy, Sketch and User Interface Design.</p>
		  		<p>I'm proud of building Juntas, an app connecting women in tech with other women in similiar fields. I'd like this website to become a support network for women and foster mentorship. I understand that developing effective content combines innovative user experience, which include web, social, and video elements and it also involves collaborating with multiple teams. I'm motivated, enthusiastic and enjoy collaborating with innovators.</p>

		  		<h4 class="main_headings"><strong> I'm An Unshakable Optimist</strong></h4>
		  		<p>I'm fasinated about human growth and development. I started in the educational sector and gradually expanded out to other industries. I enjoy connecting with people and using my skills to inspire others. For as long as I can remember, I've been interested in what makes people thrive in the midst of challenges and what makes others genuinely happy.</p>
					<p>As you can see, I love learning. I'm a dedicated learner who strongly believes in the power of the growth mindset. My experience as an instructor, mentor, advocate, office manager, and now developer have made me a blend of leading, inspiring, and educating. I'm an unshakeable optimist, committed to bring the best that I am.</p>
